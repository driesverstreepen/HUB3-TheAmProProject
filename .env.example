# Stripe Connect (OAuth) for studio payouts / onboarding
# You can find this in Stripe Dashboard → Settings → Connect settings.
# It usually starts with "ca_".
STRIPE_CONNECT_CLIENT_ID=ca_xxx

# Optional (recommended for local dev): HTTPS base URL for Stripe OAuth redirects.
# Some Stripe dashboards require HTTPS redirect URIs and will reject http://localhost.
# Use an HTTPS tunnel like ngrok/cloudflared.
# Example: https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app

# Notes:
# - Do NOT commit a real .env.local with secret keys to git. Use .env.local (gitignored) for local secrets.
# - The Stripe Dashboard requires a publicly accessible HTTPS URL for webhook endpoints and will often
#   reject plain http://localhost URLs. To test webhooks locally use one of the following options:
#     1) Stripe CLI (recommended): forwards Stripe events to your local server over a secure tunnel.
#        Example:
#          stripe login
#          stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook --events checkout.session.completed,payment_intent.succeeded
#        The `stripe listen` command will also print a webhook signing secret (whsec_...) — copy that
#        value into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your local environment or paste it in the Admin UI under
#        Stripe configuration.
#     2) ngrok: expose your local server via an HTTPS URL and register that URL in the Stripe Dashboard
#        as a webhook endpoint (e.g. https://abcd1234.ngrok.app/api/stripe/webhook).
#
# - For production, register your webhook endpoint in the Stripe Dashboard pointing to your deployed
#   domain: https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook and select the events you want (e.g.
#   checkout.session.completed, invoice.paid, payment_intent.succeeded).
#
# Quick local test flow with Stripe CLI:
# 1) Start the dev server: npm run dev
# 2) Run: stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook --events checkout.session.completed
# 3) Copy the `whsec_...` webhook secret shown by Stripe CLI and add it to your local env or Admin UI.
# 4) Trigger a test event: stripe trigger checkout.session.completed

# Protect cron-style push endpoints (set a strong random secret)
